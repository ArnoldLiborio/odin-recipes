        <p>This easy to make chicken and hominy soup is one of many great Mexican christmas traditions, or
            simply delicious whenever you want to eat something warm and comforting.
            It's granished with thinly sliced radishes, shredded lettuce, finely chopped onion, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges, which diners add 
            to the soup as they please. I love it and Im glad to share this awesome meal with as many people as possible.
